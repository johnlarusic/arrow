Everything listed here was compile with GNU gcc 3.2.2 compiler collection.
Later versions of gcc should work, as should later versions of any of the 
"required programs and libraries" listed below.

One will need root access to install the required programs in their proper
places.  Lines starting with a ">" are the command that must be run.

These instructions do not include the steps to unpack the downloaded 
programs and libraries, but generally can be achieved by the following 
commands:

    > gunzip foobar.tar.gz
    > tar -xvf foobar.tar

This should create the directory "foobar" with the uncompressed source files.

Installation steps:

   1. Download required programs and libraries
         1. Git v1.6.1: http://git-scm.com/
         2. Python v2.6.1: http://www.python.org/
         3. Scons v1.2.0: http://www.scons.org/
         4. CMPH v0.8: http://cmph.sourceforge.net/
         5. Concorde 03.12.19: http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/concorde/

   2. Install Git v1.6.1
         1. > ./configure
         2. > make
         3. > make install

   3. Install Python v2.6.1
         1. > ./configure
         2. > make
         3. > make install

   4. Install Scons v1.2.0
         1. > python2.6 setup.py install
         2. > python2.6 setup.py install --standard-lib

   5. Install CMPH v0.8
         1. > ./configure
         2. > make
         3. > make install

   6. Apply Concorde Patches (applied from root Concorde directory)
         1. > patch -p0 < ~/arrow/patches/edgelen.c.patch
         2. > patch -p0 < ~/arrow/patches/getdata.c.patch
         3. > patch -p0 < ~/arrow/patches/util.h.patch

   7. Install Concorde with either Qsopt or CPLEX LP solvers.
         a. Qsopt option
             1. > ./configure --with-qsopt=/full/path/to/qsopt.a
             2. > make
         b. CPLEX option
             1. Copy libcplex.a and cplex.h into a common directory
             2. > ./configure --with-cplex=/full/path/to/libcplex.a
             3. Edit concorde/TSP/Makefile: 
                Line 26: "LIBFLAGS = -lm -pthread"
             4. > make

   8. Install Arrow
         1. > git clone git://github.com/johnlarusic/arrow.git
            (future updates may be done via git pull command)
         2. Edit "build_options.py" to reflect the path to Concorde and the
            LP solver used in step 7.
         3. > export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib/
            (alternatively, add line to /etc/profile)
         4. > scons
